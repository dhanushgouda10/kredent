/**
 * The fixed set of departments/branches this deployment recognizes — MVJ College of
 * Engineering's actual B.E. programmes (verified against the official department listing at
 * mvjce.edu.in/programmes), not invented names. Codes are the short form used consistently
 * everywhere (student records, certificates, filters); labels are the full programme name shown
 * in the UI.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a JPA @Enumerated column type — Student.department and Certificate.department
 * stay plain String columns (no database schema change). This class is the single source of
 * truth both the frontend (via GET /api/admin/departments) and backend validation
 * (isValidCode) use to keep every future value consistent, without requiring a migration for
 * existing free-text rows written before this catalog existed.
